## About
My "RnD" of cool Silly Gosts (Ugh! remake) for future "attemts" to make my own Ugh! UWP replica ;)

## My 2 cents
- .NET Framework 4.8 & Monogame 3.8 support added (for my 12-yeard old Sony Vaio notebook)))
- Micro-RnD (I specially tried DotPeek for DoB R.E., and result is 0% of bugs, that's ideal automation!)))
- No UWP replica yet! Only .NET 4.8 at now. :)


## ..
AS IS. No support. RnD only / DIY
